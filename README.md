# Amil Silahic

Full-stack software engineer with a strong backend focus. I build scalable web applications, APIs, and developer tools, and I enjoy working on performance-critical systems, legacy modernization, and clean architecture.

I’m particularly interested in backend engineering, distributed systems, and Go-based services, while remaining comfortable across the frontend when needed.
